Test Histogram Plots with Matplotcheck
======================================

Below you will find some examples of how to use MatPlotCheck
to test histogram plots created with Matplotlib in Python.

"""

###############################################################################
# Setup
# -----
# You will start by importing the required packages and plotting a histogram.
# Once you have created your plot, you will created a Matplotcheck
# ``PlotTester`` object by providing the Matplotlib axis object to
# ``PlotTester``.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotcheck.base as mpc
import numpy as np


data = np.exp(np.arange(0, 5, 0.01))

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(data, bins=5, color="gold")

# Create a Matplotcheck PlotTester object
plot_tester_1 = mpc.PlotTester(ax)

###############################################################################
# Test a Histogram Plot
# ---------------------
# Once you have created a PlotTester object, you are ready to test various
# parts of your plot. Below, you test both
# the number of bins and the values associated with those bins.

###############################################################################
#
# .. note::
#   Throughout this vignette, the term `bin value` is used to describe the
#   number of datapoints that fall within a bin. In other words, a bin's value
#   is equal to the height of the bar corresponding to that bin. For example,
#   the value of the first bin in the above histogram is 341. Note that the
#   height of the first bar is also 341.

# Test that the histogram plot has 5 bins
plot_tester_1.assert_num_bins(5)

# Test that the histogram bin values (the height of each bin) is as expected
expected_bin_values = [341, 68, 40, 28, 23]
plot_tester_1.assert_bin_values(expected_bin_values)

###############################################################################
# And you can also run some tests that will fail.
#
try:
    plot_tester_1.assert_num_bins(6)
except AssertionError as message:
    print("AssertionError:", message)

try:
    plot_tester_1.assert_bin_values([1, 4, 1, 3, 4])
except AssertionError as message:
    print("AssertionError:", message)

###############################################################################
# Determining Expected Values
# ---------------------------
# You can use the MatPlotCheck ``get_bin_values()`` method to extract the bin
# values that are expected for a plot. This is helpful if you are using a tool
# like nbgrader to create the the expected plot outcomes in a homework
# assignment.
#
# To extract bin values from an expected plot you first create the expected
# histogram plot that you will use to grade your assignment (or htat you expect
# as an outcome from a test).  Next, you create a PlotTester object from that
# plot. Finally, you call the ``get_bin_values()`` method to grab the expected
# bin values from that plot.
#
# The steps outlined above are implemented below.

expected_data = np.sin(np.arange(0, 2 * np.pi, np.pi / 50))

# Create the expected plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(expected_data, bins=8, color="gold")

# Create a Matplotcheck PlotTester object from the axis object
plot_tester_expected = mpc.PlotTester(ax)
# Get bin values from the expected plot
print(plot_tester_expected.get_bin_values())

###############################################################################
# This example assumes that you are creating tests for a student
# assignment. Once you have created the PlotTester object for the expected
# plot (this is the answer to the assignment that you expect the student to
# come to),
# you can then test the student plot to see if it matches expected bin values.
# Below another plot is created that represents the student submitted plot.

# Create and plot the student submitted histogram
data = np.sin(np.arange(2 * np.pi, 4 * np.pi, np.pi / 50))
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(data, bins=8, color="orange")

# Test the student submitted histogram bin values against the expected
# bin values (the correct answer to the assigned plot)
plot_tester_testing = mpc.PlotTester(ax)
plot_tester_testing.assert_bin_values([23.0, 10.0, 8.0, 9.0, 9.0, 8.0, 10.0, 23.0])

###############################################################################
# Above, ``assert_bin_values()`` did not raise an ``AssertionError``. This
# means that the test passed and the student submitted plot has the correct
# histogram bins.
#

###############################################################################
#
# .. note::
#   In this example, you created the expected histogram (the homework answer)
#   and the student submitted histogram in the same file.
#

###############################################################################
# Testing with Tolerances
# -----------------------
# In some cases, you might want to run a test that doesn't require the bin
# values to match exactly. For example, it might be ok if the values are
# a few tenths off. To allow for some "wiggle room" in the expected answer,
# you can use the ``tolerance`` parameter of the ``assert_bin_values()``
# method.
#
# You will start by making two histograms with slightly different data and
# storing the plots with ``nb.convert_axes()``. The gold plot will serve as the
# expected plot, and the orange plot will serve as the testing plot.
#
# You will then create a `PlotTester` object for each plot. This allows you to
# extract the expected bin values from the expected plot and use those value to
# test the testing plot.

expected_data = 0.1 * np.power(np.arange(0, 10, 0.1), 2)
bins = np.arange(0, 10, 1)

fig1, ax1 = plt.subplots()
ax1.hist(expected_data, color="gold", bins=bins)

# Create plot tester object
plot_tester_expected_1 = mpc.PlotTester(ax1)
# Get expected bin values
bins_expected_1 = plot_tester_expected_1.get_bin_values()

###############################################################################

test_data = 0.1995 * np.power(np.arange(0, 10, 0.1), 1.7)
fig2, ax2 = plt.subplots()
ax2.hist(test_data, color="orange", bins=bins)
# Create plot tester object
plot_tester_testing_2 = mpc.PlotTester(ax2)

###############################################################################
# You'll notice that the test (orange) plot differs somewhat from the
# expected (gold) plot, but still has a similar shape and similar bin
# values.
#
# If you test it without the ``tolerance`` argument, the assertion will fail.

try:
    plot_tester_testing_2.assert_bin_values(bins_expected_1)
except AssertionError as message:
    print("AssertionError:", message)

###############################################################################
# However, if you set a tolerance, the assertion can pass. Here you will test
# it with ``tolerance=6``, as that is the maximum difference between the two
# datasets.

plot_tester_testing_2.assert_bin_values(bins_expected_1, tolerance=6)

###############################################################################
# Because no ``AssertionError`` is raised, you know that the test passed with
# a tolerance of 0.2. However, the test will not pass with a tolerance that is
# too small; the test will fail with ``tolerance=0.1``.

try:
    plot_tester_testing_2.assert_bin_values(bins_expected_1, tolerance=0.1)
except AssertionError as message:
    print("AssertionError:", message)

###############################################################################
#
# .. note::
#   When using tolerances, the ``tolerance`` argument is taken as a relative
#   tolerance. For more information, see the documentation for the
#   ``base.assert_bin_heights()`` method.

###############################################################################
# Test Histogram Midpoints
# ------------------------
# So far, you have tested the histogram values as well as the number of bins
# the histogram has. It may also be useful to test that the data bins cover
# the range of values that they were expected to. In order to do this, you can
# test the midpoints of each bin to ensure that the data covered by each
# bin is as expected. This is tested very similarly to the bins values.
# Simply provide ``assert_bin_midpoints()`` with a list of the expected
# midpoints, and it will assert if they are accurate or not. In order to obtain
# the midpoints in a PlotTester object, you can use ``get_bin_midpoints()``,
# much like ``get_bin_values()``.
#
# For this example, you will create a plot tester object from a histogram plot,
# the same way you did for the bin values example.

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(test_data, bins=8, color="gold")

# If you were running this in a notebook, the commented out  line below would
# store the matplotlib object. However, in this example, you can just grab the
# axes object directly.

# midpoints_plot_hold = nb.convert_axes(plt, which_axes="current")

plot_tester_expected_3 = mpc.PlotTester(ax)
print(plot_tester_expected_3.get_bin_midpoints())

###############################################################################
# You got the values from the plot tester object! As you can see, the values
# that were collected are the midpoints for the values each histogram bin
# covers. Now you can test that they are asserted indeed correct with an
# assertion test.

try:
    plot_tester_expected_3.assert_bin_midpoints(
        [-0.875, -0.625, -0.375, -0.125, 0.125, 0.375, 0.625, 0.875]
    )
except AssertionError as message:
    print("AssertionError:", message)

###############################################################################
# Here you can see that this will fail when given incorrect values.

try:
    plot_tester_expected_3.assert_bin_midpoints(
        [-0.75, -0.5, -0.25, -0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]
    )
except AssertionError as message:
    print("AssertionError:", message)

###############################################################################
#
# .. note::
#   Keep in mind this test is for the midpoints of the range that each bin
#   covers. So if a bin covers all data that's in between 0 and 1, than the
#   value given for that bin will be .5, not 0 or 1.


# .. note::
#   If you are working on tests for jupyter notebooks, you can call the
#   line below to capture the student cell in a notebook. Then you can
#   Use that object for testing.
#   testing_plot_2_hold = nb.convert_axes(plt, which_axes="current").
